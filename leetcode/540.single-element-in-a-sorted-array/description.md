You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly&nbsp;once. Find this single element that appears only once.

__Follow up:__ Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

__Example 1:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
</pre>

__Example 2:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
</pre>

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10^5 ``
*   `` 0 &lt;= nums[i]&nbsp;&lt;= 10^5 ``
