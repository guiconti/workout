Given a string `` s ``, find _the longest palindromic __subsequence__'s length in_ `` s ``.

A __subsequence__ is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

&nbsp;

__Example 1:__

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "bbbab"
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
</pre>

__Example 2:__

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "cbbd"
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
</pre>

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000 ``
*   `` s `` consists only of lowercase English letters.
