Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `` Employee `` table.

<pre>
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
</pre>

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `` 200 `` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `` null ``.

<pre>
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
</pre>
