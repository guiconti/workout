Given a text file `` file.txt ``, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the `` ' ' `` character.

__Example:__

If `` file.txt `` has the following content:

<pre>
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
</pre>

Output the following:

<pre>
name alice ryan
age 21 30
</pre>
