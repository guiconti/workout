# Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

# The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

# Example 1:

# Input: 

#            1
#          /   \
#         3     2
#        / \     \  
#       5   3     9 

# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
# Example 2:

# Input: 

#           1
#          /  
#         3    
#        / \       
#       5   3     

# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
# Example 3:

# Input: 

#           1
#          / \
#         3   2 
#        /        
#       5      

# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
# Example 4:

# Input: 

#           1
#          / \
#         3   2
#        /     \  
#       5       9 
#      /         \
#     6           7
# Output: 8
# Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
