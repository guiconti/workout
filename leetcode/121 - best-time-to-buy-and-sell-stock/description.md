You are given an array `` prices `` where `` prices[i] `` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a __single day__ to buy one stock and choosing a __different day in the future__ to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `` 0 ``.

__Example 1:__

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

__Example 2:__

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>
