Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `` s ``.

&nbsp;

__Example 1:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

__Example 2:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>

&nbsp;

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `` s[i] `` is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters" target="_blank">printable ascii character</a>.

&nbsp;

__Follow up:__ Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a> with `` O(1) `` extra memory.
