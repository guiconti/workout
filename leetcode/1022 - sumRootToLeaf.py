# Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.

# For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

# Return the sum of these numbers. 

# Example 1:

# Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
# Output: 22
# Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22

# Note:

# The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
# node.val is 0 or 1.
# The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.
