Given an integer array `` nums `` where&nbsp;every element appears __three times__ except for one, which appears __exactly once__. _Find the single element and return it_.

&nbsp;

__Example 1:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,3,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

__Example 2:__

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
<strong>Output:</strong> 99
</pre>

&nbsp;

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>-2<sup>31</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
*   Each element in `` nums `` appears exactly __three times__ except for one element which appears __once__.

__Follow up:__&nbsp;Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
