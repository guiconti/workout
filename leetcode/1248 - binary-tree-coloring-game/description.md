Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.&nbsp; We are given&nbsp;the `` root `` of this binary tree, and the number of nodes `` n ``&nbsp;in the tree.&nbsp; `` n `` is odd, and&nbsp;each node has a distinct value from `` 1 `` to `` n ``.

Initially, the first player names a value `` x `` with `` 1 &lt;= x &lt;= n ``, and the second player names a value `` y `` with `` 1 &lt;= y &lt;= n `` and `` y != x ``.&nbsp; The first player colors the node with value `` x `` red, and the second player colors the node with value `` y `` blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.&nbsp; In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an __uncolored__ neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if)&nbsp;a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.&nbsp; If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.&nbsp; If it is possible to choose such a `` y ``&nbsp;to ensure you win the game, return `` true ``.&nbsp; If it is not possible, return `` false ``.

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The second player can choose the node with value 2.
